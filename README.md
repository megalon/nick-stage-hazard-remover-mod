## ðŸ”§ Developing

This project requires `SlimeModdingUtilities.dll`! 

You can install it with `Slime Modding Utilites` via [Slime Mod Manager](https://github.com/legoandmars/slimemodmanager/releases/latest)

### Setup

Clone the project, then create a file in the root of the project directory named:

`NickStageHazardRemover.csproj.user`

Here you need to set the `GameDir` property to match your install directory.

Example:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Project>
  <PropertyGroup>
    <GameDir>D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl</GameDir>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

Now when you build the mod, it should resolve your references automatically, and the build event will copy the plugin into your `BepInEx\plugins` folder!
